What is most revealing, however, are the things that are neither. These are things about the way he feels. Putin is very sensitive to feeling threatened, but seems to not be very perceptive of the ways his actions may make others feel threatened and what reasonable responses from those parties would be. This obviously can create spiraling feedback, precisely what he claims to wish to avoid.\n\nFor example, his opinion that the US us not able to adapt to a changing world and instead relies on aggression may have some truth to it. This is of course hypocritical though, as this conversation is happening in the context of his initiation of what is arguably the biggest conflict since WWII because he could not accept Ukraine's right to self determination as a state. His example of Ukraine being a member of the EU, thereby affecting economics of Russia's trade with Ukraine is a perfect example. Rather than \"work things out and find solutions\" as he says in his own words, he resorted to military force, precisely what he accuses the US and NATO of doing.\n\nAnother, which I do find some merit in on his part is being threatened by NATO. It is understandable to think that one may feel threatened by NATO's expansion if one were not part of NATO. From a game theory perspective it would have been wiser by NATO to leave this possibility of becoming a member open ended for Russia, as closing it would obviously have an aggressive appearance thereby instigating an aggressive response from him.\n\nIf you suppose another scenario than the current one, that Ukraine had been a member of NATO for over a decade and it was instead the baltic states of Latvia or Lithuania that were not currently in NATO, what would Putin's choice have then been? He most likely would have invaded Latvia and Lithuania under the pretext of some historical cultural claim and needing to protect Russia from NATO expansion. Therefore his motives are duplicitous and opportunistic. He utilizes his armed forces to assert control in an opportunistic way, precisely justifying the need for NATO given that he would not risk attacking a NATO country.\n\nWould those have been his actions if NATO had never expanded in the first place, thereby making him feel threatened? It's hard to say. The disintegration of the Soviet Union did seem to be an opportunity to create a more pluralistic and less polarized world. It's too bad it was an opportunity lost. \n\nWhat I do find very reasonable to surmise is that a NATO country would never attack Russia. There is very little incentive to do this as it basically guarantees a large scale nuclear conflict and another world war. It is therefore perfectly reasonable to view NATO as a defensive organization. IE Finland and Sweden didn't join NATO because they want allies behind them when they execute some long standing plans to attack Russia. They joined NATO in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a means of guaranteeing their own security and sovereignty. Being a NATO member is simply a guarantee that others will not attack or invade your country. \n\nWhat is hard to accept as fact is that the Euromaidan protests were somehow organized at the behest of the CIA. It is an undeniable fact that protestors were killed by security forces, which Putin does not acknowledge. It seems much more reasonable to think that it was simply an organic and dynamic occurrence spurred by popular sentiment for inclusion in the EU that was further exacerbated by police killing of protestors."], ["@georgipelisie1296", "translation is perfect, but president told a lot of bool shit, but mostly people smart not enough so they pay attention to translation."], ["@Kappa1Kappa", "Anyone who studied a history of Eastern Europe knows he's talking complete bullshut)"], ["@KS-rl8dt", "https://youtu.be/raKXSdw2t2c?si=QLv1UflEGWgnr5hF"], ["@grinte2266", "who gets benefit by poisoning Navalny - Putler\nwho capable doing it - Putler\nsimple math.\nPutin Huilo"], ["@Abotekapio", "The thing is, Kievan Rus was the predecessor of Russia AND Ukraine.

Following Putin's Argument any country including Sweden could claim any other territory including Russia, in fact Sweden should have to claim Finland, Russia Poland and everything else since all of these nations Poland, Lithuania, Ukraine, Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, Finland share ethnicity. \nEven if we consider the Kievan Rus their epicenter is Kiev not Moscu and even a part of their territory reached Poland and so does Polish people have a claim to Ukraine as well?\nOver the years the Kievan Rus were divided in different kingdoms, Moscu being one of them and Kiev another. In fact, Kyiv precedes Moscu so it's not Russia that has a claim to Kiev and Ukranians it's the Ukrainians and Kiev who should have a claim to Moscu, since the epicenter of Kievan Rus was the city of Kiev, and so the Ukranians are original Kievan Rus and not the Russians. Ukraine is not a \"artificial nation\" it has way more identity than Russia itself. \nThe fact that Ukraine was part of Poland/lithuanian Commonwealth for 3 centuries after the dissolution of the Kievan Rus and the consequent mix of people and cultural assimilation separated them from Moscu as culturally different.\nThe letters sent from Ukraine to Russia in the sixteenth century and the following treaty of Pereyaslav that shifted Kyev alliance from Poland/Lithuania to Moscu also determined that the people of Kyiv were an independent kingdom as they weren't annexed by Moscu, they only formed an alliance in 1654, an alliance of 2 independent people, more importantly, this wasn't a democracy and so the people of Kyiv didn't have a say in the matter. \nHaving the same ethnicity doesn't give you a claim to a country, otherwise, Sweden/Finland should have a claim of all Kievan Rus territories.   Ukrainians had a completely different culture, they even spoke a different language as far as we know a language that was banned in the early 1800s by Russians meaning that they have always been enslaved and a hostage nation of Russia. In fact, Ukraine gained independence from Russia as a nation in 1921 after the  Ukrainian War of Independence of 1917 to 1921 produced the Makhnovshchina, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (in 1919 merged from the Ukrainian People's Republic and West Ukrainian People's Republic). The Socialist Republic of Ukraine existed since 1919 before the existence of the Soviet Union that was founded in 1922 by Russia and Ukraine as independent nations. From the very beginning of the URSS Ukraine had already been an independent republic since they had won an independence war and became unified as a nation 1 year before the URSS and this is also stated in the foundation of the URSS.\nCrimea on the other hand was part of the Ottoman Empire before Russia conquered however in 1954 URSS gave Crimea to the Ukrainian republic and so when the URSS fell Crimea belonged to the Ukranians. \nNow let's go to what really matters, the people that now live in the region are the original people of Ukraine and the majority don't want to be part of Russia and so by the principle of autodetermination Putin's arguments fall short both from a historical point of view as well as from the Ukrainian's point of viewwho voted for the president in free democratic elections to be part of European Union like other nation's of Kievan Rus origin like Poland."], ["@nasonschabell3441", "Thank you Tucker.

The corresponding question was asked to him at a meeting of the Council for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights, which was held in Moscow on December 11, 2018. \"We have to be much more liberal at some point... Treat all religions equally. [We should not] be enrolled in some kind of destructive... Jehovah's Witnesses are a Christian religion whose beliefs are based on the Bible.\n\nThe name means that believers \u201cwitness\u201d to the people around them about God through words and deeds. Jehovah is the revealed name of God, the Creator of all things, in the Bible. Jesus Christ for Jehovah's Witnesses is the Savior, the Son of God, the Mentor and the Heavenly King. They follow his teachings in their lives.\n\nBy 2017, when the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation banned the activities of all 396 registered organizations of Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia, 175,000 people actively practiced this religion in the country, and a total of approximately 300,000 Russians attended their services at least once a year. Worldwide, the number of those who attend meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses reaches more than 21 million. The Russian authorities issued the first permission for religious activity back in 1913. After the era of Soviet repressions had ended, Jehovah's Witnesses received official registration in Russia in 1992. Thereafter, their meetings for worship were attended by up to 290,000 people. In 2017, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation liquidated all legal entities and confiscated hundreds of religious buildings. Searches began, and hundreds of believers were sent to jail. In 2022, the ECHR exonerated Jehovah's Witnesses and ordered Russia to stop their criminal prosecution and to compensate them for all the harm caused. The court banned the activities of 396 registered and operating Jehovah's Witnesses organizations. This decision has been challenged in the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nThe statement of the Presidential Council for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights of 20.06.18 says: \"This decision of the [Supreme] Court contains an exhaustive list of legal entities subject to liquidation. At the same time, the court's decision does not contain conclusions about the ban on the religion of Jehovah's Witnesses as such.\"\n\nIs it allowed in Russia to practice religion without forming a legal entity? Yes. Jehovah's Witnesses have lived in Russia for more than a hundred years, and for most of that time they practiced their faith without the organizations that emerged in the late 1990s under the Freedom of Conscience Law and lasted less than 20 years. The presence or absence of such organizations does not mean the prohibition of entire religions, and even more so does not give grounds for criminal prosecution of citizens for their beliefs.\n\nIs it possible to ban people, ideas, beliefs, thoughts, and feelings? This is both impossible and unacceptable. According to Article 28 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, everyone has the right \"to freely choose, have and disseminate religious and other beliefs and to act in accordance with them.\" This right extends to believers of all views and beliefs, including Jehovah's Witnesses. No court in Russia has ever recognized the religion or beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses as criminal.
