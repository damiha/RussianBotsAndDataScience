Specifically, you, reporters and media! My people, hear me!  lying is a mortal sin.  The war in Ukraine started in 2014, to say otherwise is to heap a curse on oneself!  In 1987 Saint Pope John Paull II came to the United States of America and said \"God bless [the United States of America]\". The Soviet Union took favor on the Russian Orthodox church and put false priests into the church the same way Bella Dodd claims the Soviet Union attempted to put false priests into the American Catholic church to push Russia/Soviet Union's political ambitions.  No leaders of the USSR or Russia recognize the pope or the Roman Catholic Church until even today, Putin will not meet or acknowledge the pope. The Russian government together with the Russian Orthodox church rejected the apostolic authority of the Roman Catholic Church and instituted Christmas in January instead of December in persistent rebellion against authority claiming that the Roman Catholic Church is a false church.  Russian and Chinese Communism persecuted, imprisoned, tortured, r.aped, and murdered Christians all over the world under the Soviet and Chinese banner. The Marian Apparitions accepted by the Roman Catholic Church by the magisterium under the leading of the Holy Spirit foretold of the \"lies of Russia\" spreading over the earth and that repentance would stop the consequences. On December 25th, the Soviet Union collapsed and became Russia and many other countries emerged.  I am amazed whether in a year, 10, or 100 God's Holy Spirit breathes on the earth to make Himself known. In this move of God's will many of those nations cleaned up their acts, rejected the Russian idols and joined NATO, a blessing the United States who Russia bullies constantly and tried to bomb by placing missiles in Cuba and now more recently Venezuala.  China has joined in on bullying the United States.  As God made appearance to Moses and the Hebrews in slavery in Egypt, He appeared in Europe and Asia with the collapse of Russia//USSR's slavery of many nations.  I am amazed to see God break the Soviet Union apart on the day of Christmas, the day God instituted through the Roman Catholic Church as a remembrance of when He came to the earth as Jesus to bring salvation to all nations, the Jews and the gentiles.  The same day the Russians snubbed in rebellion.  The Baltics and so many other nations that joined NATO are a blessing for the United States of America.  Russia is a majority Christian, mostly orthodox, and the USA is majority Christian, mostly protestant.  Pope John Paul II blessed the USA over Russia and took favor on USA over Russia.  Neither orthodox or protestant churches recognize the pope or catholicism, but the USA does not persecute catholics nearly as much as Russia has.  Communism has killed and tortured hundreds of millions, and additional billions through forced abortions.  It, including Russia in it's present form who allies and yolks with CCP,  North Korea, and Islamist terrorist groups and governments who torture, imprison, and murder Christians world-wide is the greatest stumbling block to the worship of God since the days of Moses.  The territory of Ukraine including the russian occupied areas would bless the United States of America and be a great strategic acquisition to NATO.  The peoples freed to worship GOD without coercion by Russia would be a gift to God and Christian witness to Jesus Christ.
