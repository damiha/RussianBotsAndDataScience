It is disheartening to witness some Republicans openly expressing their desire for an authoritarian dictator to rule the United States.\n\nWhile I understand that political power can shift between parties, it is alarming to think that in the coming years, Republicans may regain control of the White House. The prospect of a Republican administration, regardless of whether it includes former President Trump, raises concerns about the future of our social programs, especially Social Security and Medicare. Additionally, the notion of pardoning those involved in the insurrection against our nation is troubling.\n\nThey are hurting the American people by threatening again to shut down the government in order to force the taking of American rights away from the people.\n\nIt feels overwhelming and discouraging when congressional Republicans continually obstruct voting rights and advocate for an authoritarian form of governance. It is difficult to see a way forward that ensures the preservation of our democratic values and equal participation for all citizens. In light of these challenges, I find myself questioning what steps we can take to prevent the erosion of our freedoms and avoid living under an authoritarian dictatorship.\n\nHowever, I firmly believe in the spirit of Patrick Henry's words, \"Give me liberty or give me death.\" While I understand the sentiment behind those powerful words, I argue that there are alternative paths that do not involve such extreme choices. Rather than accepting a dictatorial regime, it is crucial for us to engage in open dialogue, promote democratic principles, and actively participate in safeguarding our rights. Together, we must work towards preserving our democracy and ensuring that our government represents the will of the people.\n\nI trust that your administration is committed to upholding democratic values, protecting voting rights, and fostering an inclusive society. As a concerned citizen, I urge you to continue your efforts in championing accountability, transparency, and unity.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.

The connection was Felix Sater. Sater is a Russian-American mobster, convicted felon, real estate developer, former managing director of Bayrock Group LLC, a real estate conglomerate based out of New York City with offices in Trump tower, and a friend of Michael Cohen, Trump's lawyer, who was convicted of fraud and perjury. \nSater was an advisor to The Trump Organization. Sater worked with the Trumps on projects like Trump Soho building in NY,  Russian oligarchs purchased condominiums at inflated prices. Sater was helping Trump get approvals (needed from Putin) and funding (from oligarchs) to build a Trump tower in Moscow, effort stopped in early 2016 after Trump's campaign for president was announced. Moscow is a very rich city with wealthy people and Trump wanted to do business there.
