I usually learn so much from his guests.  Carlson came off as slightly goofy (oh that laugh!) and out of touch with the thinking of actual older people like me who HAVE lived through the many changes that have occurred since \"the greatest generation\" of WW2. The Civil Rights Movement, the feminist/sexual revolution and the Vietnam War for instance.  He kept saying he is allowed his opinions because he is so old at age 54. 54...really??  I raised a person of his generation.  The only change they made was enthusiastic adoption of the drug culture inherited by them from the hippies of the 1960s. For claiming to love America so much, this was a very anti-American interview, but maybe he was really just doing a little campaigning for Trump against the Biden administration.  I appreciate that Lex allows his guest to speak freely.  I like his interviewing style for that very reason, but I would like to have had him make Carlson just expand more on certain subjects. His explanation of why he wrote in an email that he hated Trump made no sense at all.  And his treatment of fellow Republican Nikki Haley was downright mean-spirited, also a Trump campaign talking point. Why Putin allowed him to do the interview was quite evident. Putin knew who he was dealing with.  Carlson's knowledge of Russian and Ukrainian history was  negligible and Putin's history lesson left him speechless.  It appeared the only thing he wanted to get out of the interview was the big news event he would score if he could get Putin to allow him to take home the American journalist Russia is holding.
